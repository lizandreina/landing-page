This is my second project in my The Odin Project learning journey where I replicated from an image using CSS, Flexbox layout, and of course HTML.

After reading about a lot about Flexbox and doing a few practice exercises, in this exercise I further got practiced:

- Using Flexbox properties for the parent (flex container) to achieve the desired outcome
- Working with properties for the children (flex items) to achieve the desired outcome
- Nesting classes in the CSS file to keep it organized
- Having a better understanding about when it's important to commit
