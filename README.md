Recreation of an entire web page!

This is my second project in my The Odin Project learning journey where I recreated a web page using CSS, HTML, and Flexbox layout. I was provided with font colors and sizes and used an image as a reference to replicate the web page. Through this exercise, I gained a better understanding of Flexbox properties and their practical application.

While working on this project, I practiced:
- Using Flexbox properties for the parent (flex container) to achieve the desired outcome.
- Working with properties for the children (flex items) to achieve the desired outcome.
- Nesting classes in the CSS file to keep it organized.

This exercise also helped me gain a better understanding of when it's important to commit.
